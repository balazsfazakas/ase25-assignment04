FR: 6: search meals by name, ingredient or category
NFR: 2: intuitiveness of the system

The ability to search and filter the available meals provided by the service drastically improves the usability of the service.
High intuitiveness decreases the customer's frustration and increases the discoverability of features.

Both requirements compliment each other as they increase the user-friendliness of the service
